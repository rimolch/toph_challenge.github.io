Mr. X is a school teacher. He teaches C programming to the students. In every class, he gives some simple problems to the students as a class task. One day he asked his students to solve a simple problem. That is, he will give two numbers and an arithmetic operator ( +, - , * ) in the middle of the two numbers. Students have to find out the result after the arithmetic operation. For example, Mr. X has given “10 * 20”. So, the result will be 200.

Now, suppose you are a student of his class. You have to solve this task. Can you solve it?
